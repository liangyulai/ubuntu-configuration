# Use local images without pulling from Docker

* If you are using local docker image, which is not available on Docker registry
* It will try to pull from the Docker registry and then fall back to the local
* It is kind of waste time

Pulling docker image ubuntu:v4 ...
WARNING: Cannot pull the latest version of image ubuntu:v4 : Tag v4 not found in repository docker.io/library/ubuntu

* Disable the Docker image pull

```

[sudo] password for kylin:

  executor = "docker"
  [runners.docker]
    image = "ruby:2.1"
    privileged = false
    volumes = ["/cache"]
    image_ttl = 0
```

* It will save several seconds here (from 11s down to 6s):
